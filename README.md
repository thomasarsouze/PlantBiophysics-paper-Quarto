# PlantBiophysics article website

This is the repository for the Pluto notebooks related to the scientific paper about [PlantBiophysics.jl](https://github.com/VEZY/PlantBiophysics.jl). This repo is an attempt to convert Pluto based notebooks to more generic jupyter notebooks and then using Quarto.

This repository automatically makes a website from these notebooks using Github actions and [Quarto website creation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/).

The website is available here: https://thomasarsouze.github.io/PlantBiophysics-paper-Quarto/
